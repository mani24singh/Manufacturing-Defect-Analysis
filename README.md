# Manufacturing-Defect-Analysis
Develop a model using images of manufacturing processes to identify and automate the detection of product defects in the production line.


## CASE STUDY: PRODUCTION / MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT

## Key Learning Outcomes:
- Learn how to leverage the power of data science to improve the production process and conduct predictive maintenance.
- Build and train a segmentation model to localize detects in images.
- Build and train Residual UNet mode.
- Access trained detection and segmentation models performance.
- Develop a two layered detection networks using ResNet-50 and UNet to detect and classify defects in production environment.
